- [ ] Deploy GitLab using existing HomeLab_infra role
- [ ] Setup MkDocs documentation site
- [ ] Validate automation works end-to-end

### Phase 2: Consolidation (Next Sessions)
- [ ] Create homelab-ansible repository
- [ ] Merge best practices from HomeLab_infra + ansible_base
- [ ] Migrate and test all automation roles
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automation testing

### Phase 3: Specialization (Medium Term)
- [ ] Extract network tools to homelab-network-tools
- [ ] Extract hardware tools to homelab-hardware-mgmt  
- [ ] Implement cross-repository integration
- [ ] Establish maintenance and update procedures

### Phase 4: Optimization (Long Term)
- [ ] Implement full infrastructure-as-code
- [ ] Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Develop community contribution templates
